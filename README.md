# lek-snake

I'm learning c, so I built this little app.

It's a snake for terminal. You can clone and play it by running the ./lek-snake binary directly from the terminal. It doesn't use the arrow keys, but ‘wasd’.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabrielito666/lek-snake.git && cd lek-snake && chmod +x ./lek-snake
```
```bash
./lek-snake
```
